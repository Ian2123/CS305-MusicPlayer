# CS305-MusicPlayer
CS-305 music player project
Authors: Ian Isely, Sebastian Brudz

This is a project for the CS-305 course offered at SIU-C. This project is an implementation of a music player GUI application using Qt Creator.
The functions of this application will be to upload and remove songs from a queue, play, pause, and stop songs, and be able to shuffle the
playing order of songs. The GUI will house a list of uploaded songs, being able to select from said list the song you wish to play. The
basic functionalities of the program will be accessible via buttons on the main window. The currently playing song will also show on the
main window along with some details given by the file (title, author, etc.).
